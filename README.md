## Problem Statement

The current problem we feel is that most of the chat applications are either e2e encrypted like WhatsApp or either can be accessed on multiple devices concurrently like Slack, Discord.
The reason being, Private Key is stored on the device it was created and hence it is impossible to perform e2e encryption while sending message from other device if the device with Private Key is offline.

## Solution

Encryption of Private Key generated by client using their raw credentials to ensure secure storage of Key on public device.
To authenticate an user we use token verification method hence raw credentials are not stored on server, hence the system is secured in terms of e2e encryption and storing Private Key (Encrypted using credentials) is not a issue as we are not storing credentials to decrypt it.
